Authenticate slack
1. First, we need to get your Slack user ID. You can find this by:
    Right-clicking your name in Slack
    Selecting "Copy member ID"
2. Then, you need to call the auth URL endpoint with your Slack user ID and email:
    Apply to ngrokForSlac...
    YOUR_EMAIL
3. This will return a Google Drive authentication URL that you need to visit in your browser
4. After authenticating with Google Drive, you'll be redirected back to Slack

Let me help you set this up. First, can you:
Get your Slack user ID (right-click your name in Slack and copy member ID) 
    Madhu member ID: U08NHBLHNQG
Share your email address (or you can use a placeholder email)
Once you provide these, I'll help you construct the authentication URL and guide you through the process.
